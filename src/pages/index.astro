      Hey! I'm <strong>Filipe</strong> â€” a software engineer from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, now
      living in ZÃ¼rich ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­.

      <br />
      <br />
      Dad to an incredible little boy. I love coding, cold beer, funky bass lines,
      and pretending I have free time to build side projects. This is me trying to
      put some code online and maybe make something cool along the way.
